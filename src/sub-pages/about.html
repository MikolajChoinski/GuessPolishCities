    <h2>About the idea</h2>
    <p>The project is developed by Mikołaj Choiński. I was initially inspired by the CityQuiz.io, a webiste developed by Ian Fisher, which let you type in a name of a city and then it showed it on a map and displayed a bunch of statistics on the screen. Quickly I became addicted to it and wished to see a version of the quiz containing only cities from my home country, Poland. The site is still far from being finished however, so if you have ideas how to improve it please don't hesitate to fork the project on github.</p>
    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>My name is Mikołaj Choiński. I am a law student who is also interested in coding. The GuessPolishCities is my first project that I developed so the quality of the code inside this project might be subpar, but I'll still try to fix the underlying issues as well as add new features in the future updates to the repository.</p>
    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>GuessPolishCities is a quiz game which lets you type in a name of a Polish city or village and display a marker on the location of the chosen entity on a map. There are also 4 core statistics displayed under the map and core information about the chosen entity displayed on a marker. For more information about the way to play the game check out the <a href="./howtoplay.html">how to play</a> page and if you want to know about the technologies used to create this software check out the <a href="./credits.html">credits</a> page.</p>
